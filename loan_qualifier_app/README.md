# Loan Qualifier Application:

This application was built to better assist users inquiring about obtaining a loan. The app asks 4 basic questions: what is your credit score, debt to income ratio, loan to home value ratio, and how large of a loan are you seeking?  The application takes the information provided by the user and shows them if they qualify for a loan and which banks would be willing to provide one.
